# Problem Statement: _Digital documentation of forts and heritage monuments of the State using emerging technologies._
## Theme : Mobile/WebApp
### Description: Some Indian States possesses a rich cultural heritage whose history goes back more than two millennia. Conventionally history of culture and heritage has been studied from various sources such as inscriptions, writings, records, literature, art and architecture. Modern technology has added other means through which cultural and heritage information can be captured digitally which can complement and supplement information gleaned from conventional sources. Application of 3D Laser scanning,  Remote Sensing and Geo-Spatial technologies are such modern methods used to capture details of cultural and heritage sites digitally to preserve, restore and reconstruct the glory of culture of heritage sites of the state. 
###Expectations: 
1) To Collect the data on Heritage sites and Monuments and capture the Geographical location protected monuments using GPS1
2) Geo-tagging of Photographs and Creation of the database on various parameters of all Heritage monuments using Geo-spatial technologies (GPS, GIS, RS)
3) To capture the Surface Geometric details of all these Heritage Monuments using 3D Laser Scanner for 3D Modeling 
4) Generation of 3D Point cloud data, 3D Mesh Models and CAD Engineering drawings of these monuments
5) Organization of Training programmes for Officials on utilization of Laser scanned data outputs for restoration and conservation of Heritage sites
